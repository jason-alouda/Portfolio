      <h1> Experience </h1>
      <h2> Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory </h2>
      <h3> <i> Robotics/AI intern </i> </h3>
      <p> Developed haptic perception methods on a robot to detect and learn 
          surface features like geometry, texture and friction. Implemented 
          software on Dynamixel motors, designed experiments for the robot, 
          collected data sets, and found new approaches to distinguish between 
          those overlapping features using Fast Fourier Transforms and classify 
          each feature using statistical methods and machine learning. Currently 
          working on publishing a paper. </p>

      <h2> Tennis </h2>
      <p> I've been playing tennis since I was six. I got to travel a lot around 
          the Indian Ocean and the African continent to represent my country's 
          national team in tennis. </p>

      <h3> Djason alouda </h3>
      <p> I've started DJ'ing last Summer. Now I DJ regularly for late night 
          entertainment at Stanford dining halls, and DJ occasionally at parties. 
          Back home, I've also performed in night clubs. My favorite music taste 
          is Future House and Progressive House music.
